**LigandNet**: Small Molecule-Protein Interactions Prediction Model 

**Abstract**: This notebook implements a deep learning approach to predict small molecule-protein interactions using the Big Encoded Library for Chemical Assessment (BELKA) dataset. The model is based on a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) trained on SMILES representations of molecules to classify their binding affinity to protein targets. The dataset consists of molecular structures and their corresponding binary binding labels, obtained through DNA-encoded chemical library (DEL) technology.

To enhance model performance, the notebook employs a 15-fold stratified cross-validation strategy, training separate models for each fold and storing their weights to facilitate ensembling. The preprocessing pipeline includes encoding SMILES data, feature extraction, and augmenting the dataset with additional molecular descriptors. The final predictions are generated by aggregating outputs from multiple folds. Various improvements such as alternative architectures (e.g., Transformers, LSTMs), extended training epochs, and feature engineering are suggested for further optimization.
